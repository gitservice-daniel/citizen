# Citizen Ã— alt:V Framework

Citizen is a full-sized Framework for easier developing with alt:V. It includes functionalities like a extended vehicle system and [...]. alt:V is in early development so it has no stable build and shouldn't be currently used on a server in production. If you want to contribute, do this when ever you want. And you can use the scripting-framework without asking :)
